            In order to install, you already need to have the normal version of the game.
            Then download the binary "OneLifeApp_H_windows" and place it inside your One Hour One Life folder.
            For steam users this folder is at C:\Program Files (86x)\Steam\steamapps\common\One Hour One Life

            Then execute the downloaded binary

            If you run into problems, please search in your ohol folder for cache.fcz and delete all that contain that name.
            Then log in once with the normal client, before starting the mod.
